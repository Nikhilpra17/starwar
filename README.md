# Starwar Dashboard - React Application

The Starwar Dashboard is a React-based web application designed to provide users with an immersive experience into the Star Wars universe. It features a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, functioning as a dashboard hub to explore various sections.

## Implementation Approach

## Decision-making and Future Considerations
